# Remote ID
This **unofficial** implementation covers the message formats for remote identification (Remote ID) of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) as declared in the Standard Specification for Remote ID and Tracking (ASTM F3411 - 22a).
The messages are implemented using the specification as a guideline and there is no guarantee that the implementation is correct.
